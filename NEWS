version 0.99.0
	+ Release


version 1.2.1
	+ Release

We have added a new function `ExtractHighCorFeatures.R` to track the top correlated features with expression data per topic.

We added an option for making StructureGGplot without phenotype information.

For the FitGoM function that fits the Grade of Membership model, added a maximum number of iterations input, set to 10,000 as default but flexible to user change.


version 1.5.1
	+ Release

We have added a FitGoMpool() function that automatically performs GoM model with multiple starting points
and outputs the one run with the most optimal BIC. Besides, removed switch_axis_position() as a dependency from cowplot as the function has been deprecated.


version 1.6.1
	+ Release

Deprecated the cg_topics() and  FitGoMpool() functions. Modified the FitGoM() function so that it has the flexibility
to run multiple runs using the num_trials argument and also returns the BIC for each model fit. Modified the compGoM()
function so that it can take either a topic model object, as well as a list of topic model objects. Also deprecated
the base R graphics for the Structureplot and modified the StructureGGplot() function to take single label samples.
